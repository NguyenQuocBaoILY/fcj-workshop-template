# AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 - AI/ML/GenAI on AWS Workshop
### 1. Event Information
- **Event Name:** AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 - AI/ML/GenAI on AWS Workshop  
- **Time:** 8:30 – 12:00  
- **Organizer:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)

---

### 2. Purpose of Participation
I attended the event to gain a deeper understanding of the AI/ML/GenAI ecosystem on AWS, learn the end-to-end ML lifecycle with Amazon SageMaker, explore how Foundation Models operate on Amazon Bedrock, and practice Prompt Engineering, RAG, and Agents.  
Additionally, I aimed to observe how a real GenAI chatbot is built in a live environment.

### 3. Agenda Summary

#### **8:30 – 9:00 — Check-in & Introduction**
Main activities:
- Participant check-in and networking  
- Introduction to workshop objectives  
- Ice-breaker activity  
- Overview of the AI/ML landscape in Vietnam  

**Key insight:**  
Gained an updated view of AI/ML adoption in Vietnamese enterprises and how AWS supports digital transformation through ML and GenAI.

---

#### **9:00 – 10:30 — AWS AI/ML Services Overview**
Main content:
- Introduction to Amazon SageMaker as an end-to-end ML platform  
- Data preparation and labeling  
- Model training, tuning, and deployment  
- Integrated MLOps capabilities  
- Live Demo: SageMaker Studio  

**Key insight:**  
Understood the full ML lifecycle on AWS—from data preparation → training → tuning → deployment—with hands-on exposure to SageMaker Studio.

---

#### **10:30 – 10:45 — Coffee Break**
A short break for discussion and networking with AWS experts and participants.

---

#### **10:45 – 12:00 — Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock**
Main content:
- Foundation Models: Claude, Llama, Titan — differences and selection criteria  
- Prompt Engineering: Chain-of-Thought, Few-shot learning  
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Architecture and Knowledge Base integration  
- Bedrock Agents: Multi-step workflows and tool integrations  
- Guardrails: Safety mechanisms and content filtering  
- Live Demo: Building a GenAI chatbot  

**Key insight:**  
Learned how to choose the right FM, apply prompt engineering techniques, build a complete RAG system, automate workflows with Agents, apply Guardrails, and follow the full GenAI chatbot deployment process.

---

### Key Takeaways
- Comprehensive understanding of ML and GenAI on AWS  
- Clear differences and use cases of Foundation Models (Claude/Llama/Titan)  
- Applied Chain-of-Thought and Few-shot methods to enhance model output  
- Learned prompt design for complex workflows  
- Understood the importance of RAG in enterprise applications  
- Learned how to build Agents with tool integrations  
- Hands-on experience with SageMaker Studio and end-to-end ML workflow  
- Understood how to deploy enterprise-grade GenAI chatbots using AWS tools  

---

### Practical Application
- Apply RAG to internal chatbots or document search systems  
- Use SageMaker to train or fine-tune ML models  
- Use Prompt Engineering to improve Foundation Model output quality  
- Integrate Bedrock Agents to automate business workflows  
- Build GenAI demos for team or project use  

---

### Event Experience
Attending “AI/ML/GenAI on AWS” was a highly valuable experience that strengthened my understanding of how enterprises design and deploy AI/ML and GenAI solutions in real-world environments.

---

### Highlights
- **AWS Experts:** Clear explanation of the AI/ML roadmap for Vietnam and practical demos of SageMaker and Bedrock  
- **Hands-on Sessions:** Observed the full train → tune → deploy ML workflow and GenAI chatbot building  
- **Networking:** Connected with AWS engineers and peers, learning from real GenAI case studies  
- **Lessons Learned:** GenAI is not just a model—it is a full workflow (Prompt → RAG → Agents → Guardrails). SageMaker standardizes ML lifecycle, and choosing the right FM influences cost and efficiency.

---

### Important Lessons
- GenAI requires a complete workflow, not just prompt usage  
- RAG is essential for enterprise applications using internal data  
- Agents significantly expand automation capabilities  
- SageMaker provides a scalable and structured ML development process  
- FM selection dramatically affects latency, accuracy, and cost efficiency
