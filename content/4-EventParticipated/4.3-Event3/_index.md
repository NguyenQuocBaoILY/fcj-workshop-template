# AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3 – Well-Architected Security Pillar
### 1. Event Information
- **Event Name:** AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3 – Well-Architected Security Pillar  
- **Time:** 8:30 – 12:00  
- **Organizer:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)

---

### 2. Purpose of Participation
I attended this event to gain a deep understanding of the 5 pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Security Framework, learn about modern cloud security threats, explore end-to-end security implementation from identity to incident response, and apply these principles to real-world enterprise environments.

---

### 3. Agenda Summary

#### **8:30 – 8:50 — Opening & Security Foundation**
Main content:
- Role of the Security Pillar in the Well-Architected Framework  
- Core principles: Least Privilege – Zero Trust – Defense in Depth  
- Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model  
- Common cloud security threats in Vietnamese enterprises  

**Key insight:**  
Gained a strong understanding of AWS’s security philosophy, how shared responsibility applies across service layers, and key risks in modern enterprise cloud environments.

---

#### **8:50 – 9:30 — Pillar 1: Identity & Access Management**
Main content:
- Modern IAM architecture: Users, Roles, Policies  
- Eliminating long-term credentials; using temporary access  
- IAM Identity Center: SSO and permission sets  
- SCPs & Permission Boundaries for multi-account governance  
- MFA, credential rotation, Access Analyzer  
- Mini Demo: IAM policy validation and access simulation  

**Key insight:**  
Mastered modern IAM patterns, understood why long-term credentials must be removed, and learned governance models for multi-account environments.

---

#### **9:30 – 9:55 — Pillar 2: Detection & Continuous Monitoring**
Main content:
- Organization-wide CloudTrail  
- GuardDuty threat detection and Security Hub aggregation  
- Full logging coverage: VPC Flow Logs, ALB logs, S3 access logs  
- Alerting and automation via EventBridge  
- “Detection-as-Code” security automation principles  

**Key insight:**  
Learned how to build a holistic monitoring strategy, automate threat detection and response, and treat detection rules as code.

---

#### **9:55 – 10:10 — Coffee Break**
Networking with AWS security specialists and attendees.

---

#### **10:10 – 10:40 — Pillar 3: Infrastructure Protection**
Main content:
- VPC segmentation and network isolation strategies  
- Public vs private subnet best practices  
- Security Groups vs NACLs  
- Integration of WAF + Shield + Network Firewall  
- Workload protection for EC2 and ECS/EKS environments  

**Key insight:**  
Understood layered network security, when to use each control, and how to secure compute and containerized workloads.

---

#### **10:40 – 11:10 — Pillar 4: Data Protection**
Main content:
- KMS: key policies, grants, rotation  
- Encryption at rest & in transit for S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB  
- Secrets Manager & Parameter Store rotation patterns  
- Data classification and guardrail implementation  

**Key insight:**  
Deep understanding of encryption services, secrets rotation mechanisms, and enterprise-grade data protection strategy.

---

#### **11:10 – 11:40 — Pillar 5: Incident Response**
Main content:
- AWS Incident Response lifecycle  
- Practical playbooks:  
  - Compromised IAM credentials  
  - S3 public exposure  
  - Malware detection on EC2  
- Snapshot, isolation, and evidence collection  
- Automated IR workflows with Lambda & Step Functions  

**Key insight:**  
Gained practical IR experience, learned automation patterns, and understood how to orchestrate faster incident remediation.

---

#### **11:40 – 12:00 — Wrap-Up & Q&A**
Main content:
- Summary of all 5 security pillars  
- Common enterprise challenges in Vietnam  
- Certification roadmap: Security Specialty & SA Pro  

---

### Key Takeaways
- Clear understanding of all 5 Well-Architected Security Pillars and how they interconnect  
- Strong mastery of modern IAM and Zero-Trust access control  
- Ability to implement comprehensive monitoring and automated detection  
- Knowledge of multi-layer network and workload protection  
- Deep understanding of data encryption and secrets management  
- Practical experience with real enterprise security scenarios  

---

### Practical Application
- Perform security assessments using the Well-Architected Security framework  
- Redesign IAM architecture and eliminate long-term credentials  
- Deploy automated detection systems using GuardDuty, Security Hub, EventBridge  
- Implement network segmentation and workload protection  
- Establish encryption & data classification standards  
- Develop automated incident response playbooks  

---

### Event Experience
Participating in “AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3” provided a comprehensive and practical perspective on cloud security.  
The hands-on demos, clear explanations, and real-world scenarios helped me understand how enterprises implement security at scale.

---

### Highlights
- **Expert-Led Sessions:** Delivered by experienced AWS security specialists  
- **Hands-On Demonstrations:** IAM policy validation, threat detection workflows, incident response  
- **Real Case Studies:** Practical insights from real security incidents  
- **Complete Coverage:** All 5 security pillars explained with implementation guidance  

---

### Important Lessons
- Security is a continuous process requiring active monitoring  
- Zero-Trust architecture fundamentally changes IAM strategy  
- Automation is essential to scale security operations  
- Data must be protected at every layer—from infrastructure to application
