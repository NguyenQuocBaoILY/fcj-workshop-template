# AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 – DevOps on AWS
### 1. Event Information
- **Event Name:** AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 – DevOps on AWS  
- **Time:** 8:30 – 17:00  
- **Organizer:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)

---

### 2. Purpose of Participation
I attended this workshop to understand DevOps culture and principles in cloud environments, learn how to build a complete CI/CD pipeline, master Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with CloudFormation and CDK, explore container services on AWS, and implement monitoring and observability using CloudWatch and X-Ray.  
I also wanted to apply DevOps best practices through real case studies.
