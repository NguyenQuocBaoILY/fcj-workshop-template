During my internship at [Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.] from [06/09/2025] to [end date], I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I acquired at university in a real working environment.
I participated in [**group discussions to design the project’s infrastructure architecture, analyzing AWS services and optimizing costs, deploying infrastructure components on AWS, configuring project environments, and programming to integrate various AWS services**], through which I improved my skills [**by learning and collaborating with my team, which strengthened my communication skills and technical knowledge; working directly with AWS services in a real project helped me gain deeper insights into their operations; and the project development process also enhanced my programming abilities and reporting skills**].

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
