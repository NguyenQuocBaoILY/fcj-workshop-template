>Here you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience while participating in the First Cloud Journey program, helping the FCJ team improve any remaining limitations based on the following categories:

### General Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at FCJ is very friendly and comfortable. Everyone is always willing to support me whenever I face difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is neatly organized, creating a pleasant atmosphere and helping me stay focused.

**2. Support from Mentor / Admin Team**  

My mentor always provided thorough guidance and clear explanations whenever I was unsure about something, and encouraged me to ask questions to broaden my understanding. The admin team supported me with all necessary procedures and documents and consistently created favorable conditions for my work. What I appreciate most is that my mentor did not immediately give me the answers, but instead encouraged me to try, experiment, and solve the problems on my own, which helped me learn more effectively.

**3. Alignment Between Tasks and Academic Background**  

The tasks assigned to me were closely aligned with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing new areas I had not previously encountered. Thanks to that, I strengthened my foundational understanding and acquired additional practical skills.

**4. Opportunities for Learning & Skill Development**  

During the internship, I learned many important skills such as using project management tools, team collaboration, and professional communication in a corporate environment. My mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better orient my future career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  

The company’s working culture is very positive: everyone respects one another, works seriously, yet maintains a cheerful atmosphere. When there were urgent tasks, team members supported each other regardless of their positions. This made me feel welcomed and integrated, even as an intern.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**  

The company provides internship allowances and offers flexible working hours when needed. Additionally, participating in internal training sessions is a significant advantage, helping me expand my knowledge and learn new skills.


### Additional Questions
- What did you feel **most satisfied with** during the internship?  
  --> What I was most satisfied with was the friendly working environment and the supportive team culture. My mentor and team members were always willing to explain, share experiences, and give me opportunities to try working on real tasks.

- What do you think the company should **improve for future interns**?  
  --> In my opinion, the company could organize more internal sharing sessions or activities that help interns connect with each other, which would strengthen teamwork and communication.

- If you were to refer this program to your friends, would you **recommend them to intern here**? Why?  
  --> I would definitely encourage my friends to intern here if they have the opportunity. The professional environment, supportive mentors, and practical learning experience make this an ideal place for students to develop their skills and experience corporate culture.


### Suggestions & Expectations
- Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?  
  --> During my internship, I noticed that there were not many workshops where the team could practice together and share knowledge. I suggest adding some group activities or mini competitions such as Kahoot quizzes or similar tools to help interns reinforce and remember the company’s service-related knowledge more effectively.

- Would you like to continue participating in this program in the future?  
  --> Absolutely. Personally, being able to intern here has brought me a lot of practical value and knowledge through labs and company events. It helped me understand the industry better and gain clearer career direction. The creative, friendly, and professional environment is a huge motivation for me.

- Other comments (free sharing):  
  --> I was quite nervous on my first day at the company, but fortunately the mentors were very supportive and welcoming. I hope the program continues to maintain this spirit and expand it even further so that students like us can continue to develop both personally and professionally.
